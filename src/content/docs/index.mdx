  <Card title="Modular" icon="puzzle">
    Extend functionality effortlessly through plugins written in Rust, JavaScript, or Python.  
    Plugins support various execution models and can run either on the host or within the guest environment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performant" icon="rocket">
    Malbox delivers modularity without sacrificing performance.
    It mostly leverages iceoryx2, a shared-memory IPC (Inter-Process Communication) library that enables zero-copy, lock-free communication between components.  
    Plugin developers can fine-tune behavior through configurable options, often resulting in optimized runtimes and greater adaptability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="FOSS" icon="heart">
    Maintain full control over your infrastructure—Malbox is and always will be open-source and free.  
    It supports both cloud-based and on-premise deployment for flexible storage and compute solutions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Friendly" icon="approve-check">
    Malbox features a built-in marketplace for easy installation of both official and community-verified plugins.  
    No rebuilds or restarts are needed to install new plugins.  
    All plugins and profiles adhere to strict standards, ensuring a secure and healthy ecosystem.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Declarative Configuration" icon="setting">
    Malbox is fully declarative—configuration and deployment included.  
    With integrated tools like Terraform, Packer, and Ansible, users can build images, define infrastructure, and manage machinery templates seamlessly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provider Flexibility" icon="bars">
    Malbox is not tied to any specific provider.  
    Users are free to choose their preferred technology for sandboxed environments.  
    To integrate a new provider, simply wrap it using the Malbox API.
