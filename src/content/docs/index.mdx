	<Card title="Modular" icon="puzzle">
	    Extend functionality easily through plugins, which can be written in Rust, Javascript and Python.
        Plugins support different execution models, and can run on the host or the guest.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Performant" icon="rocket">
        Malbox does not compromise on performance despite its modular plugin system. 
        It primarily uses iceoryx2, a shared-memory IPC (Inter-Process-Communication) library that enables zero-copy and lock-free communication. 
        In addition, plugin creators and users can declare and configure plugin specifics, often resulting in more optimized runtimes and adaptable use cases.
	</Card>
    <Card title="FOSS" icon="heart">
	    Retain full control over your infrastructure—Malbox will remain open-source and free forever.
        Malbox supports both cloud-based and on-premise solutions for your infrastructure and storage needs.
	</Card>
    <Card title="User Friendly" icon="approve-check">
        Malbox’s built-in marketplace makes it easy to install official and community verified plugins. 
        nstallation does not require rebuilding or restarting the Malbox service. 
        Plugins and profiles follow strict standards to ensure a healthy, thriving ecosystem.
