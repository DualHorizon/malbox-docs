## A

### Analysis Profile
A configuration set that defines how analysis tasks should be performed, including which plugins to use, VM configurations, network settings, and timeout values.

### Analysis Task
A unit of work in Malbox that represents the analysis of a specific sample with a defined profile and configuration.

### Ansible
An automation tool used by Malbox to configure virtual machines with necessary analysis tools and settings.

### Architecture (CPU)
The CPU architecture targeted by a virtual machine or plugin. Malbox supports x86 and x64 architectures.

## B

### Builder
A component in Malbox that creates customized virtual machine images using Packer.

## C

### CLI (Command Line Interface)
The command-line tool for interacting with Malbox, providing access to all system functionality.

### Communication Channel
An abstraction for message passing between components in Malbox, implemented using iceoryx2 for efficient IPC.

## D

### Downloader
A Malbox component that manages downloading and verifying source files like operating system ISOs.

### Dynamic Analysis
Analysis performed by executing a sample in a controlled environment and observing its behavior.

## E

### Environment
A deployment context in Malbox (development, staging, production) that affects logging, debugging, and other behaviors.

### Execution Context
Defines where a plugin executes - on the host system, in a guest VM, or in a hybrid configuration.

### Execution Policy
Rules that define how a plugin can execute in relation to other plugins: Exclusive, Sequential, Parallel, or Unrestricted.

## G

### Guest
A virtual machine running an analysis task.

### Guest Plugin
A plugin that runs inside a virtual machine, typically used for dynamic analysis.

## H

### Host
The machine running the Malbox core system.

### Host Plugin
A plugin that runs on the host system, typically used for static analysis.

### Hybrid Plugin
A plugin with components that run on both the host system and in guest VMs.

## I

### Infrastructure
The virtual machines, networks, and storage resources managed by Malbox.

### IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
The mechanism through which Malbox components communicate. Malbox uses iceoryx2 for efficient zero-copy IPC.

### iceoryx2
A shared memory communication library used by Malbox for efficient, zero-copy inter-process communication.

## M

### Machine
A virtual machine managed by Malbox for running dynamic analysis.

### Machine Provider
A hypervisor or virtualization platform (KVM, VMware, VirtualBox) used to run virtual machines.

### Malware
Malicious software that is the target of analysis in Malbox.

## P

### Packer
An infrastructure automation tool used by Malbox to create customized virtual machine images.

### Platform
The operating system type (Windows, Linux) of a virtual machine or analysis environment.

### Plugin
An extension module that provides specific analysis capabilities to Malbox.

### Plugin Instance
A running instance of a plugin, managed by the Plugin Manager.

### Plugin Manager
A component that manages the lifecycle of plugins, including loading, initialization, and communication.

### Plugin Registry
A catalog of all available plugins and their capabilities.

### Plugin State
The current lifecycle status of a plugin: Created, Starting, Running, Stopping, Stopped, or Failed.

## R

### Resource Manager
A component that allocates and manages virtual machines and other resources needed for analysis tasks.

### Result Server
A server component that receives analysis results from guest VMs.

## S

### Sample
A file submitted for analysis.

### Scheduler
A component that manages the execution of analysis tasks, including prioritization and resource allocation.

### Source Registry
A catalog of available operating system images and other source files that can be downloaded.

### Source Type
The type of a downloadable source file: ISO, VM Image, Container Image, Archive.

### Static Analysis
Analysis performed by examining a file without executing it.

## T

### Task
See "Analysis Task".

### Task Coordinator
A component that orchestrates the execution of analysis tasks.

### Task Queue
A prioritized list of pending analysis tasks.

### Task State
The current status of an analysis task: Pending, Initializing, PreparingResources, Running, Stopping, Completed, Failed, Canceled.

### Terraform
An infrastructure automation tool used by Malbox to provision and configure virtual machines.

## V

### VM (Virtual Machine)
An isolated environment used for dynamic analysis of malware.

### VM Image
A disk image containing an operating system and analysis tools, used to create VMs.

## W

### Worker
A process responsible for executing analysis tasks.

### Worker Pool
A collection of worker processes managed by the task coordinator.
