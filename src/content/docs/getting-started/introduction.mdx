Malbox is an advanced, open-source malware analysis platform designed to provide security researchers, malware analysts, and cybersecurity teams with a powerful, extensible environment for analyzing potentially malicious files and understanding their behavior.

## Why Malbox?

The modern threat landscape is constantly evolving, with attackers developing increasingly sophisticated techniques to evade detection. Malbox addresses several key challenges in the malware analysis space:

- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality easily through plugins, which can be written in Rust, JavaScript, and Python.
  
- **High Performance**: Malbox delivers exceptional performance through its use of Rust and efficient inter-process communication. It utilizes [iceoryx2](https://docs.rs/iceoryx2/latest/iceoryx2/), a shared-memory IPC library enabling zero-copy and lock-free communication.

- **Completely Free and Self-Hostable**: Malbox is and will remain open-source and free forever, giving you full control over your infrastructure and analysis environment.

- **User-friendly Ecosystem**: Our built-in marketplace makes it easy to discover and install official and community-verified plugins.

- **Cloud or On-Premise Deployment**: Flexibly deploy Malbox in cloud environments or on your own infrastructure.

- **Easy Deployment**: Enjoy a minimal-overhead setup with declarative configuration that reduces complexity.

## Key Features

### Analysis Capabilities

Malbox supports a wide range of analysis techniques and file types through its plugin-based architecture:

- **File Type Support**:
  - Windows Executables (PE32, PE32+)
  - Linux Executables (ELF)
  - macOS Executables (MachO)
  - Office Documents
  - PDF Files
  - Script Files (JS, VBS, PS1)
  - Archive Files

- **Analysis Features**:
  - Automated unpacking

- **Image Building**: Custom VM image creation using Packer
- **Multiple Hypervisors**: Support for KVM, VMware, and VirtualBox
- **Network Isolation**: Configurable network isolation for analysis environments

### Plugin System

The heart of Malbox is its extensible plugin system:

- **Plugin Types**:
  - Host Plugins: Run directly on the host OS for static analysis and coordination
  - Guest Plugins: Execute within VM environments for dynamic analysis
  - Hybrid Plugins: Coordinate analysis across both environments

- **Execution Models**:
  - Exclusive: Plugin must be executed alone
  - Sequential: Plugins run in sequence
  - Parallel: Multiple plugins run simultaneously
  - Unrestricted: No special requirements

## Technology Stack
